      desc: "The high quality of education will always be my main reason as to why I want to study abroad. While there is no shortage of premier universities in my country, the undeniable truth is that they pale in comparison to their counterparts in places such as the UK or the U.S. International universities have access to resources which made their brand of education so renowned in the first place, such as facilities, industry connections and of course, the funding.In short, I simply want to learn from the best. Studying abroad in a prestigious university is not only a once in a lifetime opportunity, but it also ensures a brighter future for me and my career.",

      desc: " There isn't a more exciting privilege in life than to be able to discover new places, meet new people, and to just surround yourself in traditions and cultures that are entirely different from your own. Getting to experience these things and more is one of the biggest reasons as to why I want to study abroad. Also, not everyone is blessed with such an opportunity, making it even more priceless.",

      desc: "Another reason as to why I want to study abroad is that I’ll get to add another language to my vocabulary, which is always a huge confidence booster.Never in a million years did I think that I’ll be able to speak another foreign language aside from English. So, when I finally learned how read, write and speak in Swedish, it gave me such a tremendous sense of pride and accomplishment to know that my hard work has finally paid off.",

      title:"4.Can find attractive employment opportunities",
      desc: "Studying internationally also gives me the chance to explore the foreign job market where opportunities are generally more rewarding, career and salary-wise. If I’m lucky, I’ll be able to land a role in a prestigious multi-national company or something just as rewarding.And even if the job search doesn’t pan out, I could always return back home with a very attractive resume in hand. Local employers value professionals who can bring something new and unique to the table, and being a graduate from an international institution certainly fits the bill.",
